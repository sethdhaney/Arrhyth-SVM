Arr_SVM.py: 

This file uses the sci-kit learn support vector machine classifier to
classify ECG readings into 16 different categories of the cardiac 
arrhythmia. Due to missing data a feature and a few examples have been 
removed rather than using imputation. 

The classifier gets approximately 25% error rate on the cross-validation
set.  The data set is taken from
